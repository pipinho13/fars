# The fars package
## Short introduction

The fars package includes a few functions that are useful for working with data
from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis 
Reporting System.

The included functions are:

- `fars_read`
- `make_filename`
- `fars_read_years`
- `fars_summarize_years`
- `fars_map_state`

The functions that are of main interest are `fars_summarize_years` for 
returning the observations per month and `fars_map_state` to plot a map of 
a certain state (idetified by number) during a certain year.

For the functions to work the package expects suitable files from the FARS 
system in the working directory. The filenames should follow the standard 
naming scheme as used by `make_filename`. For example:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(fars)
make_filename(2013)
```
